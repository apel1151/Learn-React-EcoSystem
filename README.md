# MERN Stack Project Structure: Best Practices

MERN stack is a popular web development technology stack that includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It is a very powerful stack that allows developers to build scalable and robust web applications. In this tutorial, we'll discuss the MERN stack project structure and how it can help you build better web applications.

MERN Stack Project Structure
The MERN stack project structure is organized in a way that separates the backend and frontend code. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. This pattern allows developers to separate the concerns of the application into three main components.

# Model
The Model component is responsible for managing the data and the business logic of the application. In the MERN stack, MongoDB is used as the database, which stores the data used in the application. The model's directory contains the database schema and the functions that interact with the database.

# View
The View component is responsible for displaying the data to the users. In the MERN stack, React.js is used as the frontend framework. The components directory contains the React components that are responsible for rendering the user interface.

# Controller
The Controller component is responsible for handling the user input and updating the Model and View components accordingly. In the MERN stack, the backend code is built using Node.js and Express.js. The controller's directory contains the functions that handle the HTTP requests and responses.

# Server Directory

The server directory contains the backend code of the web application. The backend code is built using Node.js and Express.js. The server directory contains the following directories and files:

 ## *** config directory: This directory contains the configuration files of the backend application.
 ## *** controllers directory: This directory contains the controllers of the application.
 ## *** models directory: This directory contains the models of the application.
 ## *** routes directory: This directory contains the routes of the application.
 ## *** server.js file: This file is the entry point of the backend application.
# Client Directory

The client directory contains the front-end code of the web application. The frontend code is built using React.js. The client directory contains the following directories and files:

public directory: This directory contains the HTML file that is displayed in the browser.
src directory: This directory contains the source code of the frontend application. The src directory contains the following directories and files:
components directory: This directory contains the React components of the application.
App.js file: This file is the main file of the frontend application that renders the components.
index.js file: This file is the entry point of the front-end application.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the MERN stack project structure is organized in a way that separates the backend and frontend code. It also follows the MVC architecture pattern. The client directory contains the frontend code, and the server directory contains the backend code. The MERN stack project structure helps in building scalable and robust web applications. By separating the concerns of the application, the codebase becomes more manageable and easier to maintain. If you're looking to build a web application using the MERN stack, it's highly recommended that you follow this project structure.

# Routing:
              1. React Router Dom: One of the most popular routing libraries for react is react-router-dom. React router provided a simple and declarative way to handle routing in your react application allowing you to define routes and render different components based on the current URL.
                            2. TanStack Router: 
                            3. If you are using next.js you donâ€™t have to worry about chossing a routing library as next.js has routing built in. 

Client State Management:  
                                                                    Client  State Management refers how your applicatoin organized and how the data flows between your components.
                                                 Redux: 
                                             A popular state management library for react is redux-toolkit. It provides a simplified API for defining and updating State as well as built-in support for features such as immutable updates, serializable action type and more.
                             Redux-toolkit: 
                                                                  Another state management library for react that provides simple and lightweight solution for managing state in your application. It provides a built-in mechanism for subscribing to state changes allowing you to easily keep your UI and syncwith your data. It is a great choice to developers who want a lightweight and easy to use State management solution without the overhead of a larger Library like redux.
